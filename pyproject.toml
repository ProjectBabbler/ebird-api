# line-length: this is just the default but it's included here so it's easy
# to see that the value is synced with other code quality tools.
#
# target-version: the python version is set when the project is generated
# so we might as well make use of it.
#
# exclude: the regex for excluding migrations is added in case you don't
# want them reformatted.
#
# For all options see:
