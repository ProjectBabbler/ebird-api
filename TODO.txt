TODO Add integration tests
     The recent bug where sppLocale was being used to fetch the taxonomy
     was not caught because the unit tests were simply checking the code
     runs. Some integration tests are needed to verify the calls to the
     API really are working. However these should only be run when a release
     is going to be made. It's too expensive in terms of time and goodwill
     to be hitting the eBird API every time the (unit) tests are run.

TODO Bump2version should be updating the release date in CITATION.cff

TODO Move all configuration options into pyproject.toml
     - bump2version
