## [3.0.7] - 2024-10-09
### Changed
- get_taxonomy now passes "locale" as a parameter, not "sppLocale",
  which was ignored so all names were returned in English.

## [3.0.6] - 2020-09-09
### Changed
- Subnational1 and subnational2 codes were assumed to be at least two
  characters. Now they are at least 1 character. 

## [3.0.5] - 2019-08-31
### Changed
- Replaced the checklistSort query parameter for the top_100 end-point 
  with rankedBy. This change was made by eBird as checklistSort was not
  working.

## [3.0.4] - 2019-07-22
### Changed
- Update the functions for fetching observations to use the sppLocale 
  query parameter to match the recent changes made in the eBird API.

## [3.0.3] - 2019-07-16
### Changed
- When fetching observations, the list of area may only contain 10 items.
  Previously more than 10 were allowed but this was a bug and was fixed to 
  limit the load on the server. 

## [3.0.2] - 2019-06-22
### Changed
- Updated the validation check for region codes so it supports ISO 3166-2. 
- Disabled the validation check that limited the number of areas to 10 as 
  the eBird API does not currently enforce this.

## [3.0.1] - 2019-06-15
### Added 
- Added the full list of locales support by eBird (but not necessarily by the API).
- Added a convenience function for saving downloaded records to a file.
### Changed
- Validating the locale now uses the list supported by eBird.

## [3.0.0] - 2019-06-06
### Added 
- Rewritten to support eBird API 2.0

## [2.1.1] - 2019-05-14
### Changed

## [2.1.0] - 2017-08-20
### Changed
- Improved the documentation in the README.
- Project now uses the MIT license.

### Added 
- Added scripts so each API call can be made on the command line.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-02-27
### Changed 
- Moved all the functions into the 'api' module and changed the top-level
'ebird' module to be namespaced (PEP420).

### Added

- Added function for fetching nearby hotspots.
- Added function for fetching lists of hotspots for a region.
### Changed
- Renamed list_locations() to list_regions() and find_locations() to 
find_regions() as "locations" refer to specific sites in the functions 
that fetch observations.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-02-18
### Added
- Functions for fetching locations from the eBird API.
### Changed
- Updated setup.py project description and list of languages supported.

## [0.1.1] - 2017-02-14
### Changed

avoid any issues with representation.

## [0.1.0] - 2017-02-13
